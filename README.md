## 🧱 Professional Foundation

Before focusing on Generative AI, I spent several years as a Data Engineer and BI Developer,
working on large-scale enterprise data platforms in banking and automotive environments.

This background enables me to design AI systems that are:
- Data-driven and reliable  
- Scalable and production-oriented  
- Well-integrated with existing enterprise systems
